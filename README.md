A high-performance computational physics engine designed to solve the **1D Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation** and simulate **Identical Particle Thermalization** in a Canonical Ensemble.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was originally developed for the **Statistical Physics** course at the **Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA)**. It implements a high-order numerical solver to explore how quantum particles behave under different potential constraints and thermal conditions.

### Scientific Core:
- **Numerical Method:** Matrix Numerov (O(dx⁴) accuracy) for solving Eigenvalue problems.
- **Statistical Framework:** Canonical Ensemble (Boltzmann distribution) to calculate thermal densities.
- **Identical Particles:** Spatial symmetrization and antisymmetrization for Bosons and Fermions.
- **Spin Statistics:** Implementation of Spin-1/2 (Fermionic) and Spin-1 (Bosonic) mixtures.
- **Potentials:** Infinite/Finite Square Wells, Truncated Harmonic, and V-Shaped (Linear) Wells.

## 🛠 The Refactoring Journey (Software Architecture Focus)

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate the transition from **Scientific Prototyping** to **Professional Software Architecture**. 

I am currently refactoring the original procedural notebook into a modular, script-based Python library, applying **SOLID principles**, **OOP Design Patterns**, and industry-standard practices.

### Architectural Improvements:
- **Procedural ➔ OOP:** Encapsulating physics entities (Potentials, Solvers, States) into clean class hierarchies.
- **Dependency Injection:** Decoupling the Physics Solver from specific potential implementations.
- **Type Safety:** Full integration of Python Type Hinting for robust scientific computing.
- **Modularity:** Strict separation of concerns between the Physics Engine, Data Models, and Visualization logic.
- **Maintainability:** Transitioning from "linear spaghetti" notebooks to an importable Python package.
